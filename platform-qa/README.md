# Platform QA Test suite

The Platform QA suite uses Cucumber BDD feature scripts and runs those tests through Selenium.

## To run the tests

Clone the repository and also make sure you have maven to run.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<fill in here>
cd platform-qa
mvn clean verify -Pintegration-tests
```
